# AI Projects

A collection of small AI projects I’ve built in highschool and while studying the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER).  
All projects use Python (PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib) and focus on exploring the fundamentals of neural networks and data processing.

## Projects

### 1. [MNIST Digit Classifier](./MNIST)
A convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.  
**Technologies used:** PyTorch  
**Features:**
- Model training and evaluation  
- CNN model with two convolutional layers  
- Prediction samples display  

### 2. [Emotion Recognition](./Emotion-Recognition)
Facial emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset.  
**Technologies:** PyTorch, OpenCV  
**Features:**
- CNN with three convolutional layers  
- Classification of seven basic emotions  
- Very similiar to MNIST Digit Classifier, just a bit more complex
- Add more convolutions/epochs to make it work better, its not a simple problem!  

### 3. [Number Addition Network](./Addition)
A very simple neural network that learns to add two decimal numbers without being explicitly taught the addition rule.  
**Technologies:** PyTorch, NumPy  
**Features:**
- Small dataset  
- End-to-end supervised learning  
- Loss visualization during training
